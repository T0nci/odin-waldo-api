# Hidden in Plain Sight

This project was a fun little game(inspired by the popular game Where's Waldo/Wally) where I solidified previous knowledge and learnt and implemented some new things:

- cross site cookies
- back-end tests with SuperTest

Hidden in Plain Sight is a Jamstack website(made up of PostgreSQL, Express and React) consisting of 2 parts:

- RESTful API back-end(this repository) with the following endpoints:
  - get all maps and their info
  - start a game
  - guess a character
  - get a game's info
  - update a game's name
  - get the leaderboard for all maps
- front-end where players can:
  - select a map and start a game
  - play a game
  - see their score(time) and optionally leave their name
  - see the leaderboard for each map
